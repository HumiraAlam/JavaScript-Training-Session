Promise
-------
what is promise?
    -promise is a special object 
    -represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.
    -It allows to handle asynchronous operations more easily 

How it is created?
    it is created using promise() constructor

What is construcor?
    a spectial function in JS tha create a special Object

Purpose of promise?
    to store Success Data or Failure Data/Error Data

    promise object---promise()constructor

    <<var mypromise= new promise()>>



What is resolve & reject?
    -both are pre-defined functions
    -used to store data in promise object

    --if data is stored in promise object useing resolve(), that is <<success data>>
    ---if data is stored in promise object useing reject(), that is <<Failure/error data>>

   -------------------------------------------
 A promise can be in one of three states:

1. Pending: 
        Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected...empty promise object
2. Resolved / Fulfilled: 
        The operation completed successfully. 
        if data is stored using resolve()
3. Rejected: 
        The operation failed.
        if data is stored using reject()


        Accessing data from promise object
        -----------------------------------
Promises have two primary methods for interacting with them:

1. then(): 
    This method is used to handle the result of a promise when it is fulfilled.
2. catch(): 
    This method is used to handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the promise.


    Handling Promise object
    ------------------------
99% you will have to handle promise object and 1% is to create

        promiseObj.then(function(res){
            ----
            -----
        }).catch(function(error){

        })
